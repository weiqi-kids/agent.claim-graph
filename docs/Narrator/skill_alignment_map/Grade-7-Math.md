| Standard ID | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.RP.A.1 | Compute unit rates associated with ratios of fractions, including ratios of lengths, areas and other quantities measured in like or different units. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.RP.A.2 | Recognize and represent proportional relationships between quantities. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.RP.A.3 | Use proportional relationships to solve multistep ratio and percent problems. Examples: simple interest, tax, markups and markdowns, gratuities and commissions, fees, percent increase and decrease, percent error. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.NS.A.1 | Apply and extend previous understandings of addition and subtraction to add and subtract rational numbers; represent addition and subtraction on a horizontal or vertical number line diagram. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.NS.A.2 | Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication and division and of fractions to multiply and divide rational numbers. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.NS.A.3 | Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving the four operations with rational numbers. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.EE.A.1 | Apply properties of operations as strategies to add, subtract, factor, and expand linear expressions with rational coefficients. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.EE.A.2 | Understand that rewriting an expression in different forms in a problem context can shed light on the problem and how the quantities in it are related. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.EE.B.3 | Solve multi-step real-life and mathematical problems posed with positive and negative rational numbers in any form (whole numbers, fractions, and decimals), using tools strategically. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.EE.B.4 | Use variables to represent quantities in a real-world or mathematical problem, and construct simple equations and inequalities to solve problems by reasoning about the quantities. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.G.A.1 | Solve problems involving scale drawings of geometric figures, including computing actual lengths and areas from a scale drawing and reproducing a scale drawing at a different scale. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.G.A.2 | Draw (freehand, with ruler and protractor, and with technology) geometric shapes with given conditions. Focus on constructing triangles from three measures of angles or sides, noticing when the conditions determine a unique triangle, more than one triangle, or no triangle. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.G.A.3 | Describe the two-dimensional figures that result from slicing three-dimensional figures, as in plane sections of right rectangular prisms and right rectangular pyramids. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.G.B.4 | Know the formulas for the area and circumference of a circle and use them to solve problems; give an informal derivation of the relationship between the circumference and area of a circle. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.G.B.5 | Use facts about supplementary, complementary, vertical, and adjacent angles in a multi-step problem to write and solve simple equations for an unknown angle in a figure. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.G.B.6 | Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, volume, and surface area of two- and three-dimensional objects composed of triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes, and right prisms. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.SP.A.1 | Understand that statistics can be used to gain information about a population by examining a sample of the population; generalizations about a population from a sample are valid only if the sample is representative of that population. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.SP.A.2 | Use data from a random sample to draw inferences about a population with an unknown characteristic of interest. Generate multiple samples (or simulated samples) of the same size to gauge the variation in estimates or predictions. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.SP.B.3 | Informally assess the degree of visual overlap of two numerical data distributions with similar variabilities, measuring the difference between the centers by expressing it as a multiple of a measure of variability. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.SP.B.4 | Use measures of center and measures of variability for numerical data from random samples to draw informal comparative inferences about two populations. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.SP.C.5 | Understand that the probability of a chance event is a number between 0 and 1 that expresses the likelihood of the event occurring. Larger numbers indicate greater likelihood. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.SP.C.6 | Approximate the probability of a chance event by collecting data on the chance process that produces it and observing its long-run relative frequency, and predict the approximate relative frequency given the probability. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.SP.C.7 | Develop a probability model and use it to find probabilities of events. Compare probabilities from a model to observed frequencies; if the agreement is not good, explain possible sources of the discrepancy. |
| CCSS.Math.Content.7.SP.C.8 | Find probabilities of compound events using organized lists, tables, tree diagrams, and simulation. |
