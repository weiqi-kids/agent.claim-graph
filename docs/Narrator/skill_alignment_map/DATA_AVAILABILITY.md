# Skill Alignment Map - Data Availability

## Available Grade Levels

Currently, the US Common Core Math standards dataset contains complete standards for:

- **Grade 4**: 28 standards
- **Grade 8**: 28 standards

## Missing Grade Levels

The following grade levels are **not available** in the current dataset:

- Grade 3
- Grade 5
- Grade 6
- Grade 7

## Additional Data in Dataset

The dataset also contains High School (HS) level standards across multiple domains:
- Algebra (HSA)
- Functions (HSF)
- Geometry (HSG)
- Number & Quantity (HSN)
- Statistics & Probability (HSS)

## Data Source

All data extracted from:
- [Common Standards Project](https://www.commonstandardsproject.com)
- Dataset: `/docs/Extractor/standards_frameworks/raw/us_common_core_math_standards.jsonl`
- Total records: 534 lines
- Extraction date: 2026-02-06

## Next Steps

To obtain complete Grade 3-8 coverage, consider:
1. Verifying if the data source contains all grades or just these specific grades
2. Checking alternative US Common Core data sources
3. Fetching from the Common Standards Project API directly with grade-level filtering
